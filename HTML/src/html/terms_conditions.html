                                                The inclusion of limitation of liability disclaimers is a primary motivation for business owners to incorporate terms and conditions on their websites. When crafted reasonably and effectively, these clauses serve as a crucial safeguard, shielding your business from potential claims and lawsuits, thereby mitigating the financial impact of damages.
